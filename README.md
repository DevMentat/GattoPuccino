# GattoPuccino
Take a Sip!
GattoPuccino is a command-line tool that takes an image file and applies a coffee-themed color palette to it. It supports four different flavors - latte, frappe, macchiato, and mocha - and saves the modified image in an output folder in the same directory as the executable. GattoPuccino uses the ImageMagick command-line tool to apply the color palette.
Based on Catppuccin theme and Catppuccinifier script.
